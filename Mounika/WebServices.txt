                                   WEB SERVICES

	They work on http protocol . "web services" defines what kind of request is sent  and response is received between any two servers (or) server to system (or) system to system . 

Two types:
1.SOAP(simple object access protocal)
2.REST


SOAP API: We need to follow some parameters while sending SOAP request:

1.Focusing on EndPoint URL:
Ex:http://www.facebook.com/login
   http://www.facebook.com/CreateAccount

For example,Above URL will be created by dev team and tested by testing team to check wheather the page is navigating to correct URL or not.

2.Request and Response only in XML format.
Ex:
Request
<username>Mounika</username>
<password>1234</password>
*Once the request is sent to server,server checks weather the given data is in server or not and sends the response in XML format.

3.Response
Ex:
<result>success</result>

*SOAP is used in earlier,In present technology "REST " is used.

Disadvantages:
1.Can pass the request only in XML format only.
  *whereas in REST API ,can pass the request in many ways(will discuss in REST API)

REST API

1.Endpoint URL

2.In REST ,request and response can be sent in multiple ways like
XML
JSON
STRING
DOCUMENT

3.Types of calls/operations;
*Create/POST
*Retrive/GET
*update/PUT
*Delete/DELETE

4.Responce in XML OR JSON format.
username/password--authentication

5.Responce code:
Ex:505,100 etc

SOME OF TOOLS FOR TESTING WEB SERVICES

1.POSTMAN-Used to Test REST API
2.JMETER-REST
3.SOAP UI.SOAP
4.REST CLIENT-REST
5.REST ASSUERD-REST
6.JerseyClient-REST
7.HTTP Client-REST
