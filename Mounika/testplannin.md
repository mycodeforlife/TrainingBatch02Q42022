Test planning is a detailed document which describes test areas and test activities.
It outlines 
Test strategy
Objectives
Test schedule
Test estimation
Test deliverables
It plays important role while testing because it includes all the actions which we need to perform during testing.
There are some types in test planning
 Master test plan: It includes all the types of test planning which is nothing but test strategy.
Phase test plan : it describes any one phase of test strategy like list if test cases
Specific test plan : it includes some of important testing like security testing,load testing,performance testing and so on

The priority if bugs can be low ,medium and high like p1,p2 and p3
The severity of bugs can be as below
Blocker : which stops the flow of testing
Critical : which has high impact on application
Major :which need to be fixed depending on importance
Minor :which can be fixed and released later
Testing environments :software and hardware environments are available
Software environments include OS like windows,linus etc and Browsers like crome,safari etc
Hardware environments include RAM and ROM
